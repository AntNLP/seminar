Time: **1:00 pm - 3：30 pm, Friday**

Venue: B714, Science Building.

Welcome to AntNLP Seminar 2020 Fall :)

## On Papers

- Please choose recent papers (2020, 2019) from top NLP/AI venues. A (incomplete) list is
  - NLP: ACL, TACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL
  - ML:  ICML, NeurIPS, AISTATS, JMLR, ICLR
  - AI:  AAAI, IJCAI
  - IR/DM: SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, KDD, WWW

- While we are interested in a broad range of NLP/AI topics, the followings (and a list [here](https://slack-files.com/T22T1UP8Q-FLT6K0WDV-c037db5283)) are of great importance

  - syntactic/semantic parsing
  - entity/relation/event extraction
  - distributed/distributional/compositional semantics
  - MT/QA/Dialog
  - graph neural networks
  - (deep) learning algorithms

- Materials with broad interests are welcome (e.g., tutorials form top conferences, high-quality surveys).

- Please fill your slots in the [Agenda](#agenda) **at least one week** before your presentation.
  - Please format Paper fields with *[venue+year]title* (e.g. [ACL20]A Good Paper).
  - Please upload your slides, and add links to them in Slides fields.
