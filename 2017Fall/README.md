# AntNLP Seminar -- 2017 Fall

Time: 18:00 pm, Wednesday

Venue: - TBD


## On Papers
- Please choose recent papers (2017, 2016) from top NLP/AI venues. A (incomplete) list is
  - NLP: ACL, TACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL  
  - ML:  ICML, NIPS, AISTATS, JMLR, ICLR  
  - AI:  AAAI, IJCAI  
  - IR/DM: SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, KDD, WWW  
- While we are interested in a broad range of NLP/AI topics, the followings 
(and a list [here](https://slack-files.com/T22T1UP8Q-F726RJERH-9a39cc3d9a)) are of great importance
  - syntactic/semantic parsing  
  - entity/relation/event extraction  
  - distributed/distributional/compositional semantics
  - MT/QA/Dialog  
  - (deep) learning algorithms  

- Materials with broad interests are welcome (e.g., tutorials form top conferences, high quality surveys).  

## For Presenters
- Please fill your slots in the [Agenda](#agenda) **at least one week** before your presentation.  
  - Use the format *[venue+year]title" in the Paper column (e.g. [ACL17]A Good Paper).   
  - Please upload your slides, and also add the links to them in the Slides column.  
- Besides technical novelties, please give enough background knowledge in case people are unfamiliar with the topic.    
- It would be great to keep your presentation within 60 min.   

## For Audiences   
- Please read abstract/introduction sections before the seminar
