 # AntNLP Seminar -- 2019 Fall

Time: 3:00 pm, Tuesday

Venue: Science Building B914.

Welcome to AntNLP Seminar 2019 Fall. :)

## On Papers

- Please choose recent papers (2019, 2018) from top NLP/AI venues. A (incomplete) list is
  - NLP: ACL, TACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL
  - ML:  ICML, NeurIPS, AISTATS, JMLR, ICLR
  - AI:  AAAI, IJCAI
  - IR/DM: SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, KDD, WWW

- While we are interested in a broad range of NLP/AI topics, the followings (and a list [here](https://slack-files.com/T22T1UP8Q-F726RJERH-9a39cc3d9a)) are of great importance

  - syntactic/semantic parsing
  - entity/relation/event extraction
  - distributed/distributional/compositional semantics
  - MT/QA/Dialog
  - (deep) learning algorithms

- Materials with broad interests are welcome (e.g., tutorials form top conferences, high quality surveys).

## For Presenters

- Please fill your slots in the [Agenda](#agenda) **at least one week** before your presentation.
  - Please format Paper fields with *[venue+year]title* (e.g. [ACL19]A Good Paper).
  - Please upload your slides, and add links to them in Slides fields.
- Besides technical novelties, please give enough background knowledge in case people are unfamiliar with your topic.
- It would be great to keep your presentation within 60 min.

## For Audiences

- Please read abstract/introduction sections before the seminar.
