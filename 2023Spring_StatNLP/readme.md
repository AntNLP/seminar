# Statistical Natural Language Processing Seminar -- 2023 Spring

Time: **9:50, Thursday**

Venue: Tin Ka Ping Building 234 (田家炳楼234)

Welcome to StatNLP Seminar 2023 Spring. : )

## On Papers

- Please choose recent papers (2023, 2022, 2021) from top NLP/AI venues. A (incomplete) list is
  - NLP: ACL, TACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL
  - ML: ICML, NeurIPS, AISTATS, JMLR, ICLR
  - AI: AAAI, IJCAI
  - IR/DM: SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, KDD, WWW
- While we are interested in a broad range of NLP/AI topics, this year we will pay special attentions on two themes
  - foundation models (pre-training models)
  - explaining methods
- We hope that, with high probability, you choose papers from [here](https://github.com/AntNLP/seminar/blob/master/2023Spring_StatNLP/2023-paper-list.md)
- other materials with broad interests are welcome (e.g., tutorials form top conferences, high-quality surveys).
