# AntNLP Seminar -- 2022 Spring

Time: **3:00 pm, Friday**

Venue: B914, Science Building; Online

Welcome to AntNLP Seminar 2022 Spring. : )

## On Papers

- Please choose recent papers (2021, 2020) from top NLP/AI venues. A (incomplete) list is
  - NLP: ACL, TACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL
  - ML: ICML, NeurIPS, AISTATS, JMLR, ICLR
  - AI: AAAI, IJCAI
  - IR/DM: SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, KDD, WWW
- While we are interested in a broad range of NLP/AI topics, the followings (and a list [here](https://slack-files.com/T22T1UP8Q-FLT6K0WDV-c037db5283)) are of great importance
  - syntactic/semantic parsing
  - entity/relation/event extraction
  - distributed/distributional/compositional semantics
  - MT/QA/Dialog
  - (deep) learning algorithms
- Materials with broad interests are welcome (e.g., tutorials form top conferences, high-quality surveys).

## For Presenters

- Please fill your slots in the Agenda at least one week before your presentation.

  - Please format Paper fields with *[venue+year]title* (e.g. [ACL21]A Good Paper).
- Please upload your slides, and add links to them in Slides fields.
  
- Besides technical novelties, please give enough background knowledge in case people are unfamiliar with your topic.

- It would be great to keep your presentation within 60 min.

## For Audiences

- Please read abstract/introduction sections before the seminar.
