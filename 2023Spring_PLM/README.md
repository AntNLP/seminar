## Presenters
- Our seminar scheduler is mostly adapted from following courses, feel free to find the course materials from them:
    - JHU CSCI 601.771: [Self-supervised Statistical Models](http://self-supervised.cs.jhu.edu/)
    - COS 597G (Fall 2022): [Understanding Large Language Models](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall22/cos597G/)
    - Stanford CS324 : [Large Language Models](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/lectures/)
- Each talk is provided a given topic and some key phrases. Your talk should focus on the topic and introduce some related works. Good Luck !

## Non-Presenters
